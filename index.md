Welcome to my humble homepage.  
Actually, Here is a *hub* to my other online profiles and beings.

I am a curious learner and strong enthusiast of software technologies and methodologies.  
I follow and discuss (and sometimes write) software technology news, trends, articles and posts mostly at:

As like every developer, I have some traces in :

My notes and posts related to my learning and sharing journey is only in *dev.to* and *medium*.

Good learnings! :)
